### [1] [Cropland Mapping using Geospatial Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02923)
*Ivan Zvonkov,Gabriel Tseng,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Hannah Kerner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估地理空间嵌入在Togo农田制图中的应用效果，发现其能简化工作流程并实现高精度分类，支持土地利用变化及其气候影响的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确和最新的土地覆盖图对于理解土地利用变化至关重要，这是气候变化的关键驱动因素。地理空间嵌入提供了一种更高效和可访问的景观特征制图方式，但在实际制图应用中的使用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用Presto和AlphaEarth的地理空间嵌入来制作Togo的农田地图。

Result: 地理空间嵌入能够简化工作流程，实现高精度的农田分类。

Conclusion: 地理空间嵌入可以简化工作流程，实现高精度的农田分类，并最终支持更好地评估土地利用变化及其气候影响。

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [2] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出生成式提示训练方法，通过生成模型创建虚拟样本来直接在整个输入空间中强制执行已知的不变性，相比传统数据增强方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法仅在训练数据的变换上学习不变性，无法完全捕捉这些属性，需要一种能直接在整个输入空间中强制执行已知不变性的方法。

Method: 使用在训练集上训练的生成模型来近似输入分布并生成未标记的虚拟图像，然后在半监督方式下同时训练分类和提示目标，利用未标记的虚拟样本来引导模型学习期望的提示属性。

Result: 在多个数据集、架构和损失函数上，生成式提示在学习相同属性时始终优于标准数据增强。在细粒度视觉分类基准上，相比使用数据增强的微调模型，实现了最高1.78%的top-1准确率提升，在CheXpert X射线数据集上平均性能提升1.286%。

Conclusion: 生成式提示是一种有效的训练方法，能够直接在整个输入空间中强制执行已知的不变性，显著优于传统的数据增强技术。

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

### [3] [ProM3E: Probabilistic Masked MultiModal Embedding Model for Ecology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02946)
*Srikumar Sastry,Subash Khanal,Aayush Dhakal,Jiayu Lin,Dan Cher,Phoenix Jarosz,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E是一个概率掩码多模态嵌入模型，用于生态学中任意模态到任意模态的生成。该模型基于嵌入空间中的掩码模态重建，能够根据少量上下文模态推断缺失模态，支持嵌入空间中的模态反转，并通过概率特性分析不同模态融合的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发生态学中任意模态到任意模态的生成模型，解决多模态数据融合和缺失模态推断的问题，提升跨模态检索和表示学习能力。

Method: 基于掩码模态重建的嵌入空间学习，通过概率模型学习推断缺失模态，支持模态反转，并提出混合模态间和模态内相似度的跨模态检索方法。

Result: 模型在所有检索任务中实现了优越性能，通过线性探测任务展示了其优秀的表示学习能力。

Conclusion: ProM3E为生态学多模态数据提供了一个强大的生成和表示学习框架，能够有效处理模态缺失和融合问题，并在跨模态检索任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

### [4] [EvtSlowTV - A Large and Diverse Dataset for Event-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02953)
*Sadiq Layi Macaulay,Nimet Kaygusuz,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvtSlowTV是一个从YouTube视频构建的大规模事件相机数据集，包含超过130亿个事件，用于解决事件相机深度估计中数据标注不足的问题。该数据集支持自监督学习框架，无需帧级标注，能提升模型在复杂场景和运动中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和低延迟的优势，但在深度估计中受限于小规模标注数据集，难以泛化到真实场景。需要构建大规模数据集来提升事件相机深度估计的泛化能力。

Method: 从公开的YouTube慢动作视频构建EvtSlowTV数据集，包含超过130亿个事件，涵盖多种环境条件和运动类型。采用自监督学习框架，利用事件流的高动态范围特性，无需帧级标注。

Result: EvtSlowTV数据集比现有事件数据集大一个数量级，提供了不受约束的自然场景数据。实验表明使用该数据集训练能增强模型在复杂场景和运动中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvtSlowTV数据集为事件相机深度估计提供了大规模、多样化的训练数据，通过自监督学习框架有效利用了事件流的优势，提升了模型在真实场景中的性能。

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

### [5] [Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992)
*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的混合CNN-ViT神经架构搜索空间，用于在严格模型大小限制下寻找高效的图像分类架构，该架构在CIFAR10数据集上表现出优于基于ResNet的tinyML模型的准确性和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合CNN-ViT架构虽然性能优于纯CNN或ViT架构，但参数量大、计算成本高，不适合tinyML部署。需要寻找在严格模型大小约束下的高效混合架构。

Method: 设计了一个新的混合CNN-ViT神经架构搜索空间，包含混合CNN和ViT块以学习局部和全局信息，以及新颖的可搜索池化层池化块用于高效特征图缩减。

Result: 在CIFAR10数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的搜索空间能够产生在严格模型大小约束下具有优越准确性和推理速度的混合CNN-ViT架构。

Conclusion: 提出的混合CNN-ViT搜索空间能够有效找到适合tinyML部署的高效图像分类架构，在模型大小受限条件下优于ResNet-based tinyML模型。

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

### [6] [SCALE-VLP: Soft-Weighted Contrastive Volumetric Vision-Language Pre-training with Spatial-Knowledge Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02996)
*Ailar Mahdizadeh,Puria Azadi Moghadam,Xiangteng He,Shahriar Mirabbasi,Panos Nasiopoulos,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP是一个软加权对比视觉语言预训练框架，专门针对医学CT等体积数据设计，通过整合体积空间语义和领域知识语义，在有限监督下实现结构一致和语义基础的表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要局限于2D数据和二元监督，忽略了体积数据（如CT）中的连续结构化依赖关系，且通常将体积扫描视为独立的2D切片，损害了空间连贯性并未能充分利用丰富的临床语义。

Method: 提出SCALE-VLP框架，整合(i)体积空间语义以保持解剖结构，(ii)领域感知的知识注入语义（如放射学本体）来指导对齐，采用软加权对比学习方法。

Result: 相比之前最先进方法，SCALE-VLP在CT-报告检索上实现高达4.3倍的top-1性能提升，异常分类提高10个百分点，报告生成达到ROUGE-L 0.44和BERT-F1 0.89。在零样本跨域评估中也观察到一致增益。

Conclusion: SCALE-VLP在有限监督下产生结构一致和语义基础的表示，展现出强大的跨任务可迁移性和跨域泛化能力，无需进一步微调即可获得一致性能提升。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

### [7] [Learning with less: label-efficient land cover classification at very high spatial resolution using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03004)
*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自监督学习的高效标签方法，仅使用1000个标注图像块实现州级1米分辨率土地覆盖分类，通过BYOL预训练策略和多种语义分割架构，在密西西比州超过1230亿像素上达到87.14%总体精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习语义分割方法在大范围高分辨率土地覆盖制图中需要大量标注训练数据的挑战，降低人工标注成本。

Method: 使用BYOL自监督预训练策略，在大量未标记彩色红外航空图像上预训练ResNet-101编码器，然后将学习到的权重迁移到多个深度语义分割架构中，使用极小训练数据集进行微调。

Result: 通过最佳性能U-Net模型集成，在8类土地覆盖制图中获得87.14%总体精度和75.58%宏F1分数，准确映射了开阔水域和森林区域，但在农田、草本和荒地类型区分上存在挑战。

Conclusion: 自监督学习是减少手动标注数据需求的有效策略，直接解决了大规模高空间分辨率土地覆盖制图的主要限制。

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

### [8] [A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于脑部MRI的基础模型，能够处理不同成像序列组合。该模型使用单一编码器，通过可学习模态嵌入、条件层归一化和考虑缺失模态的掩码自编码目标来实现多模态适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法需要为每种模态训练单独模型的问题，开发能够适应不同序列组合和缺失模态的统一模型，提高脑部MRI分析的灵活性和效率。

Method: 使用单一编码器架构，结合可学习模态嵌入、条件层归一化和掩码自编码目标。应用方差-协方差正则化器稳定特征学习，通过自监督重建和模态插补在约60,000个多中心MRI上进行训练。

Result: 初步结果表明该方法可行，能够在不同模态设置下工作。计划在脑肿瘤和多发性硬化分割以及病变分类任务上进行进一步评估。

Conclusion: 该模型成功实现了单一模型处理不同MRI序列组合的能力，无需为每种模态训练单独模型，为脑部MRI分析提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced by deep learning
architectures, notably U-Net variants. However, existing models struggle to
achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning
under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose
a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation.
Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range
reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers,
simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic
abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending
state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on
challenging inpainting/outpainting tasks including editing or adding objects
over hundreds of frames and demonstrate superior performance to baseline
methods like Wan 2.1 model and VACE in terms of quality (PSNR/SSIM), and
perceptual realism (LPIPS). Our method enables practical long-range video
editing with minimal overhead, achieved a balance between parameter efficient
and superior performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are
released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for
human-centric 3D modeling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human
action recognition systems suitable for real-world edge applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

TL;DR: ARC是一种新颖的、无需标注的缓存框架，通过动态管理小型高价值语料库来优化基于RAG的LLM智能体性能，显著减少存储需求并提升检索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG在提升智能体性能方面取得成功，但针对每个智能体动态构建、维护和更新紧凑相关语料库的智能体级缓存管理仍未被充分探索。

Method: ARC通过综合历史查询分布模式和缓存项在嵌入空间中的内在几何结构，自动维护高相关性缓存。

Result: 在三个检索数据集上的实验表明，ARC将存储需求降低至原始语料库的0.015%，提供高达79.8%的答案命中率，并将平均检索延迟降低80%。

Conclusion: ARC能够显著提升基于RAG的LLM智能体的效率和有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been
propelled by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grants the models
access to vast external knowledge bases. Despite RAG's success in improving
agent performance, agent-level cache management, particularly constructing,
maintaining, and updating a compact, relevant corpus dynamically tailored to
each agent's need, remains underexplored. Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent
RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that
dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing
historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached
items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance
cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our
experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to
0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and
reducing average retrieval latency by 80%. Our results demonstrate that ARC can
drastically enhance efficiency and effectiveness in RAG-powered LLM agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了LEGO-Eval评估框架和LEGO-Bench基准，用于评估3D场景生成与细粒度指令的对齐程度，发现当前方法在生成符合真实世界环境的场景方面存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D场景生成方法缺乏真实的空间布局和物体属性，这源于粗粒度指令的不足。需要更详细的细粒度指令来生成真实世界环境，否则训练出的具身智能体会学习到与现实世界物理和语义不符的先验知识。

Method: 引入LEGO-Eval评估框架，配备多样化工具来显式地接地场景组件，实现更准确的对齐评估。同时提出LEGO-Bench基准，包含详细指令来指定真实世界环境的复杂布局和属性。

Result: 实验表明LEGO-Eval在评估场景-指令对齐方面比VLM-as-a-judge高出0.41 F1分数。使用LEGO-Bench基准测试显示当前生成方法存在显著局限性，所有评估方法在生成完全符合细粒度指令的场景时成功率最多只有10%。

Conclusion: 需要更先进的3D场景生成方法来满足细粒度指令的要求，LEGO-Eval和LEGO-Bench为评估和改进此类方法提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for
automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic
spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this
problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,
advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions
that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic
scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to
learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,
degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment
between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for
effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and
vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.
This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D
scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address
this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse
tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate
alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed
instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world
environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge
by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with
LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods.
Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in
generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.

Motivation: ABSA研究资源主要集中在商业领域，而教育、医疗等高需求低资源领域存在分析需求未满足的问题。传统评估方法对边界变化过于严格，无法准确反映生成模型性能。

Method: 提出FTS-OBP评估方法；系统研究小型解码器语言模型在ABSA任务中的表现，探索无数据（上下文学习和权重合并）和少数据微调方法；提出多任务微调策略。

Result: FTS-OBP方法与传统指标保持强相关性并提供细粒度诊断；1.5-3.8B参数的小型模型在仅使用200-1000个示例的情况下，性能超越专有大模型并接近基准结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源领域的ABSA任务提供了有效的评估方法和模型解决方案，推动了ABSA在教育等低资源领域的发展。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained opinion mining
approach that identifies and classifies opinions associated with specific
entities (aspects) or their categories within a sentence. Despite its rapid
growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in
commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet
low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation
challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive
in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas.
Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly
rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent
the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through
three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text
Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates
realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation
with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present
the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs;
<7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education
review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and
weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask
fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling
1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark
results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first
public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in
low-resource domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中许多场景（如远程医疗、呼叫中心、智能眼镜）只能记录对话的一方，这限制了对话AI的应用，因此需要研究如何从单边对话中推断和学习完整对话内容。

Method: 使用MultiWOZ、DailyDialog和Candor数据集，评估提示方法和微调模型，通过人工A/B测试和LLM作为评判指标，研究未来轮次信息和话语长度对重建的影响，以及占位符提示减少幻觉的效果。

Result: 研究发现：访问一个未来轮次和话语长度信息能改善重建效果；占位符提示有助于减少幻觉；大模型通过提示能生成有希望的重建结果，而小模型需要微调；无需重建缺失轮次也能生成高质量摘要。

Conclusion: 1SC是一个新颖的挑战，本文报告了有希望的结果，标志着向隐私感知对话AI迈出了一步。

Abstract: Conversational AI is constrained in many real-world settings where only one
side of a dialogue can be recorded, such as telemedicine, call centers, and
smart glasses. We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC):
inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1)
reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2)
generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and
finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B
testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and
information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder
prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate
promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning.
Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing
turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that
mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.

Conclusion: PolyNorm方法有效减少了人工干预需求，支持多语言文本归一化研究，并发布了多语言基准数据集。

Abstract: Text Normalization (TN) is a key preprocessing step in Text-to-Speech (TTS)
systems, converting written forms into their canonical spoken equivalents.
Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial
engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language
coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a
prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to
reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic
applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a
language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed
to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments
across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER)
compared to a production-grade-based system. To support further research, we
release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of
text normalization phenomena.

Abstract: Language disruptions are one of the well-known effects of schizophrenia
symptoms. They are often manifested as disorganized speech and impaired

reflect underlying cognitive disturbances and have the potential to serve as
objective markers for symptom severity and diagnosis of schizophrenia. This
study focuses on how these language disruptions can be characterized in terms
of two computational linguistic measures: surprisal and semantic coherence. By
computing surprisal and semantic coherence of language using computational
models, this study investigates how they differ between subjects with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, this study provides further
insight into how language disruptions in terms of these linguistic measures
change with varying degrees of schizophrenia symptom severity.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect millions worldwide, yet early detection
remains a major challenge, particularly for Arabic-speaking populations where
resources are limited and mental health discourse is often discouraged due to
cultural stigma. While substantial research has focused on English-language
mental health detection, Arabic remains significantly underexplored, partly due
to the scarcity of annotated datasets. We present CARMA, the first
automatically annotated large-scale dataset of Arabic Reddit posts. The dataset
encompasses six mental health conditions, such as Anxiety, Autism, and
Depression, and a control group. CARMA surpasses existing resources in both
scale and diversity. We conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses of
lexical and semantic differences between users, providing insights into the
linguistic markers of specific mental health conditions. To demonstrate the
dataset's potential for further mental health analysis, we perform
classification experiments using a range of models, from shallow classifiers to
large language models. Our results highlight the promise of advancing mental
health detection in underrepresented languages such as Arabic.

Abstract: This paper proposes a control-based framework for aligning large language

filter to the predicted token generated from the baseline LLM, to intervene in
the generated text. The safety filter includes two significant advantages: this
safety filter is an add-on type, allowing it to be used for alignment purposes
without fine-tuning the baseline LLM, and if there is an evaluation model
regarding the desired alignment, it can be directly applied to the filter
design. The overall text-generation system is implemented with open-source
language models, aiming to generate positive text.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As reasoning models scale rapidly, the essential role of multimodality in
human cognition has come into sharp relief, driving a growing need to probe
vision-centric cognitive behaviors. Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either
overemphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing
vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs
insufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC
(Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded
benchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three
fundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and
knowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs'
cognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct
extensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that
closed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs.
30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak
(less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns,
including orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and
poor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that
Chain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason ->
verify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a
shift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both
evaluation and model design.

Abstract: Understanding how different stakeholders perceive risks in AI systems is
essential for their responsible deployment. This paper presents a framework for
stakeholder-grounded risk assessment by using LLMs, acting as judges to predict
and explain risks. Using the Risk Atlas Nexus and GloVE explanation method, our
framework generates stakeholder-specific, interpretable policies that shows how
different stakeholders agree or disagree about the same risks. We demonstrate
our method using three real-world AI use cases of medical AI, autonomous
vehicles, and fraud detection domain. We further propose an interactive
visualization that reveals how and why conflicts emerge across stakeholder
perspectives, enhancing transparency in conflict reasoning. Our results show
that stakeholder perspectives significantly influence risk perception and
conflict patterns. Our work emphasizes the importance of these
stakeholder-aware explanations needed to make LLM-based evaluations more
transparent, interpretable, and aligned with human-centered AI governance
goals.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly pervasive, finding
applications across many industries and disciplines. Ensuring the
trustworthiness of LLM outputs is paramount, where Uncertainty Estimation (UE)
plays a key role. In this work, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted to
examine the robustness and effectiveness of diverse UE measures regarding
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in LLMs. It involves twelve different UE
methods and four generation quality metrics including LLMScore from LLM
criticizers to evaluate the uncertainty of LLM-generated answers in
Question-Answering (QA) tasks on both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Our analysis reveals that information-based
methods, which leverage token and sequence probabilities, perform exceptionally
well in ID settings due to their alignment with the model's understanding of
the data. Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit
superior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in
capturing the model's epistemic uncertainty. Semantic consistency methods,
which assess variability in generated answers, show reliable performance across
different datasets and generation metrics. These methods generally perform well
but may not be optimal for every situation.

Abstract: As multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) gain traction across South Asia,
their alignment with local ethical norms, particularly for Bengali, which is
spoken by over 285 million people and ranked 6th globally, remains
underexplored. Existing ethics benchmarks are largely English-centric and
shaped by Western frameworks, overlooking cultural nuances critical for
real-world deployment. To address this, we introduce BengaliMoralBench, the
first large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural
contexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting,
Family Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally
relevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus
using three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct
systematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including
Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and
standard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative
analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense
reasoning, and moral fairness. BengaliMoralBench provides a foundation for
responsible localization, enabling culturally aligned evaluation and supporting
the deployment of ethically robust AI in diverse, low-resource multilingual

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong semantic understanding, yet
struggle when user instructions involve ambiguous or conceptually misaligned
terms. We propose the Language Graph Model (LGM) to enhance conceptual clarity
by extracting meta-relations-inheritance, alias, and composition-from natural
language. The model further employs a reflection mechanism to validate these
meta-relations. Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these
relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM,
improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses.
Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely
on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to
process texts of any length without the need for truncation. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that the LGM consistently outperforms existing
RAG baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in generating fluent utterances but can
lack reliable grounding in verified information. At the same time,
knowledge-graph-based fact-checkers deliver precise and interpretable evidence,
yet suffer from limited coverage or latency. By integrating LLMs with knowledge
graphs and real-time search agents, we introduce a hybrid fact-checking
approach that leverages the individual strengths of each component. Our system
comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid
one - hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a
task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based
logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient.
Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the
Supported/Refuted split without task- specific fine - tuning. To address Not
enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that
our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled
as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM
reviewers. With this paper, we present a modular, opensource fact-checking
pipeline with fallback strategies and generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Tokenizers play a crucial role in determining the performance, training
efficiency, and the inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs). Designing
effective tokenizers for multilingual LLMs is particularly challenging due to
diverse scripts and rich morphological variation. While subword methods such as
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) are widely adopted, their effectiveness in
multilingual settings remains underexplored. We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a
tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and
multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading
to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in
fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data,
our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by
18% over Sutra (the current best). This translates to 44% improvement in
inference throughput over LLaMA4 while maintaining comparable performance on
English and Indic benchmarks. We also present detailed ablations across
tokenizer training data size, vocabulary size, merging techniques, and
pre-tokenization strategies, demonstrating the robustness of our design
choices.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is emerging as a powerful technique to
enhance the capabilities of Generative AI models by reducing hallucination.
Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs)
has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in
question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance
of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat,
Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA
tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation
metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary
questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini,
alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired
with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its
status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's
Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary
and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b
reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas
LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research
underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with
proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that
progress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling
parameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that
inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all
pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies
and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original
functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation,
which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented
initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative
Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to
acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as
SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and
SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing
between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography
benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion
while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean
corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and
competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best
overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when
preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and
adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning
setups.

excelling at expressive and iterative audio editing encompassing emotion,

synthetic data, which circumvents the need for embedding-based priors or
auxiliary modules. This large-margin learning approach enables both iterative
control and high expressivity across voices, and represents a fundamental pivot
from the conventional focus on representation-level disentanglement. Evaluation
results demonstrate that Step-Audio-EditX surpasses both MiniMax-2.6-hd and
Doubao-Seed-TTS-2.0 in emotion editing and other fine-grained control tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically
performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference
translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the
limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from
the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that
neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with
human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the
source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments
between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct
the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular
focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not
available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual
proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and
back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch
between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried
out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with
diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts
constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word
error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a
computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our
cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT
metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled
evaluation methodologies for speech translation.

Abstract: A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is
the emergence of "reasoning MLLMs" that offer explicit control over their
internal thinking processes (normally referred as the "thinking mode")
alongside the standard "non-thinking mode". This capability allows these models
to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating
a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these
"dual-state" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning
processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical
tasks. This paper evaluates the active "thinking mode" capabilities of two
leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We
assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and
ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the
thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for
the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as
open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal,
highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced
methods for medical knowledge integration.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative
approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics,
proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To
systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review
proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting
items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to
evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive
performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for
advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological
analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics
subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),
which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern
recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model
architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to
targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant
benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data
integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.
RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and
synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests
the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that
impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust
evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular
datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as
CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly
support the training and generalization of GenAI models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly
widespread, especially in sensitive applications where fairness is essential
and biased outputs can cause significant harm. However, evaluating the fairness
of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize
standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook
deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive
fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work,
we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences
encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by
safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases
often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which
present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with
additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to
uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals
during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects,
presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future
development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment
training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings
expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their
underlying fairness issues.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in automated negotiation has
set a high performance benchmark, but their computational cost and data privacy
requirements render them unsuitable for many privacy-sensitive, on-device
applications such as mobile assistants, embodied AI agents or private client
interactions. While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative,
they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing
emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This
paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability
gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates
game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional
states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs
with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating
conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent
simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial
debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show
that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt
recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its
size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles
to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints.
Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw
model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation,
paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators
that can operate on the edge.

Abstract: For complex logical data augmentation, heavy reliance on human annotation is

uninterpretable and logically homogeneous examples. To address this, we present
LFC-DA, a symbolic-logic-controlled pipeline: logical text is first mapped to
propositional expressions, a compact rule library is compiled, and a bounded
state-space search systematically discovers valid formulas that are then
verbalized back into natural-language questions, ensuring both diversity and
logical rigor under propositional logic. Experiments on ReClor and LogiQA show
significant improvements in the logical-reasoning accuracy of pretrained
models, confirming the effectiveness of LFC-DA for LLM-guided logical data
augmentation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing Machine Translation (MT) research often suggests a single, fixed set
of hyperparameters for word segmentation models, symmetric Byte Pair Encoding
(BPE), which applies the same number of merge operations (NMO) to train
tokenizers for both source and target languages. However, we demonstrate that
this uniform approach doesn't guarantee optimal MT performance across different
language pairs and data sizes. This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes
across various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system
performance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target
languages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the
symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K
sentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant
($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in
low-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language
pairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut),
observing statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems
compared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K
to 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results,
particularly benefiting low-resource MT.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have shown promises for relation extraction (RE)
when extracting RDF triples guided by SHACL shapes focused on common datatype
properties. This paper investigates how SLMs handle both datatype and object
properties for a complete RDF graph extraction. We show that the key bottleneck
is related to long-tail distribution of rare properties. To solve this issue,
we evaluate several strategies: stratified sampling, weighted loss, dataset
scaling, and template-based synthetic data augmentation. We show that the best
strategy to perform equally well over unbalanced target properties is to build
a training set where the number of occurrences of each property exceeds a given
threshold. To enable reproducibility, we publicly released our datasets,
experimental results and code. Our findings offer practical guidance for
training shape-aware SLMs and highlight promising directions for future work in
semantic RE.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have leveraged explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to improve reasoning accuracy. However, most
existing methods primarily compress verbose reasoning outputs. These
Long-to-Short transformations aim to improve efficiency, but still rely on
explicit reasoning during inference. In this work, we introduce \textbf{3TF}
(\textbf{T}hought-\textbf{T}raining and \textbf{T}hought-\textbf{F}ree
inference), a framework for efficient reasoning that takes a Short-to-Long
perspective. We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning
and non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to
internalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs
at inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based
approaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs,
enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping
external outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large
improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference,
demonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed
implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.

Abstract: Input errors in question-answering (QA) systems often lead to incorrect
responses. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently
failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering
the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a
framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it
enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related
entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to
align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our
results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding
faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more
effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's
ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two
strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question
correction task.

Abstract: Critical appraisal of scientific literature is an essential skill in the

support in this task, their reliability remains limited, particularly for
critical reasoning in specialized domains. We introduce CareMedEval, an
original dataset designed to evaluate LLMs on biomedical critical appraisal and
reasoning tasks. Derived from authentic exams taken by French medical students,
the dataset contains 534 questions based on 37 scientific articles. Unlike
existing benchmarks, CareMedEval explicitly evaluates critical reading and
reasoning grounded in scientific papers. Benchmarking state-of-the-art
generalist and biomedical-specialized LLMs under various context conditions
reveals the difficulty of the task: open and commercial models fail to exceed
an Exact Match Rate of 0.5 even though generating intermediate reasoning tokens
considerably improves the results. Yet, models remain challenged especially on
questions about study limitations and statistical analysis. CareMedEval
provides a challenging benchmark for grounded reasoning, exposing current LLM
limitations and paving the way for future development of automated support for
critical appraisal.

Abstract: RDF pattern-based extraction is a compelling approach for fine-tuning small

that advances this approach to meet the demands for completing and refining
knowledge bases in specialized domains. Kastor reformulates the traditional
validation task, shifting from single SHACL shape validation to evaluating all
possible combinations of properties derived from the shape. By selecting the
optimal combination for each training example, the framework significantly
enhances model generalization and performance. Additionally, Kastor employs an
iterative learning process to refine noisy knowledge bases, enabling the
creation of robust models capable of uncovering new, relevant facts

Abstract: Large language models work well for technical problem solving in English but
perform poorly when the same questions are asked in Bangla. A simple solution
would be to translate Bangla questions into English first and then use these
models. However, existing Bangla-English translation systems struggle with
technical terms. They often mistranslate specialized vocabulary, which changes
the meaning of the problem and leads to wrong answers. We present BanglaSTEM, a
dataset of 5,000 carefully selected Bangla-English sentence pairs from STEM
fields including computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and
biology. We generated over 12,000 translations using language models and then
used human evaluators to select the highest quality pairs that preserve
technical terminology correctly. We train a T5-based translation model on
BanglaSTEM and test it on two tasks: generating code and solving math problems.
Our results show significant improvements in translation accuracy for technical
content, making it easier for Bangla speakers to use English-focused language
models effectively. Both the BanglaSTEM dataset and the trained translation
model are publicly released at https://huggingface.co/reyazul/BanglaSTEM-T5.

Abstract: Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI
agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during
memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory
hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions.
Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question
answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within
the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the
Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines
three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question
answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different
operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct
user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and
HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type
questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns,
with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations
across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based
on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate
hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently
propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus
on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that
systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.

Abstract: Understanding how well large language models can follow users' instructions
throughout a dialogue spanning multiple topics is of great importance for
data-intensive conversational applications. Existing benchmarks are often
limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and
failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we
propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following
ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from
user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints,
instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by
enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and
tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated
user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the
interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving
instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types.
Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following
performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and
demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant
margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind. All of the data and code
will be made publicly available online.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Any finite set of training data is consistent with an infinite number of
hypothetical algorithms that could have generated it. Studies have shown that
when human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on
hierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples.
A recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network
architectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special
conditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora,
or when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the
first time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in
human-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements:
stack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer,
simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack
of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed
by DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic
stacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question
formation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture
that improves hierarchical generalization. These results suggest that
stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language
acquisition than standard architectures, serving as useful objects of
psycholinguistic study. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Measuring the full abilities of large language models (LLMs) requires
benchmarks representing multiple tasks. We aim to create large, high-quality
datasets for comparison of logical reasoning skills across several languages
and of suitable difficulty for LLMs of various reasoning ability. We explore
multiple ways of increasing difficulty. We generate zebra puzzles in multiple
languages, themes, sizes and including 14 different clue types and 8 red
herring types (uninformative clues). We find puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 are
sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a
reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini
puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5
puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the
common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no
correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of
128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic
languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5. We publish code for puzzle generation,
designed for adaptablity into more languages and themes.

Abstract: This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable
locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that
enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization
through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models
that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows
dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and
efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We
conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer
architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\lambda} across
the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our
results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower
attention entropy, with {\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18
bits at {\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer
fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets.
Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the
tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\lambda} = 0.6
achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings
establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for
applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability,
offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance
spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design
principles.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
better support policymakers in their crucial work of understanding, analyzing,
and crafting legal regulations. To equip the model with a deep understanding of
legal texts, we curated a supervised dataset tailored to the specific needs of
the legal domain. Additionally, we integrated the Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) method, enabling the LLM to access and incorporate up-to-date
legal knowledge from external sources. This combination of fine-tuning and
RAG-based augmentation results in a tool that not only processes legal
information but actively assists policymakers in interpreting regulations and
drafting new ones that align with current needs. The results demonstrate that
this approach can significantly enhance the effectiveness of legal research and
regulation development, offering a valuable resource in the ever-evolving field

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward
unseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data
augmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between
text and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD
focus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating
explanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by
their over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that
lack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it
difficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our
study, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an
interpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target
implicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and
explicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers
stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the
relevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model
towards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,
thus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales
based on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive
dimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's
attitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark
datasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%
training data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the
proposed architecture and interpretable design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
conspiratorial tendencies, whether they display sociodemographic biases in this
domain, and how easily they can be conditioned into adopting conspiratorial
perspectives. Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of
misinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a
critical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are
increasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known
about whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a
conspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated
psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under
different prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs
show partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning
with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent
demographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses
toward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs
to manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive
contexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the
psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social
science and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.

Abstract: Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing
common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while
referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme
for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures
speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression,
enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over
time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k
annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the
resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings
are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies
systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask
referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an
analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating
(V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative
dialogue.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业自动化系统在复杂多变的环境中运行，需要处理驾驶和工作过程的双重约束，现有ODD概念无法满足农业应用的独特挑战。

Method: Ag-ODD框架包含三个核心元素：基于ASAM Open ODD和CityGML的结构化描述概念、扩展的7层模型（包含过程层）、以及迭代验证过程。

Result: 该框架为创建明确且可验证的Ag-ODD提供了一致方法，演示用例表明其能支持自主农业系统环境描述的标准化和可扩展性。

Conclusion: Ag-ODD框架有效解决了农业自动化系统环境描述的挑战，为农业自主系统的开发和验证提供了结构化、透明和可验证的方法。

Abstract: The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that
operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications,
agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which
imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring
consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a
structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,
existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique
challenges of agricultural applications.
  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,
which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of
autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core
elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured
method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters
using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model
derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process
layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative
verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical
scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness
and consistency.
  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating
unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD
Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental
descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.

Motivation: 由于成本和安全性考虑，传统物理测试不切实际，需要采用虚拟测试环境(VTE)作为替代方案。比较VTE生成的传感器输出与其真实世界对应物可以验证VTE的准确性。

Method: 采用综合实验方法测试不同评估指标在噪声、密度、失真、传感器方向和通道设置下的敏感性和准确性。构建虚拟测试环境，使用配备LiDAR、IMU和摄像头的仪器车辆在受控环境中收集真实LiDAR扫描数据。

Result: 密度感知Chamfer距离(DCD)在所有情况下表现最佳。模拟和真实LiDAR扫描在语义分割输出上相似，mIoU为21%（校正强度后），平均DCD为0.63。DCD被发现是与感知方法最相关的指标。

Conclusion: 模拟和真实LiDAR扫描在几何属性上存在轻微差异，模型输出存在显著差异。密度感知Chamfer距离是评估LiDAR扫描相似性的有效指标，与感知方法具有良好相关性。

Abstract: For developing safe Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), rigorous testing is
required before they are deemed safe for road deployments. Since comprehensive
conventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,
Virtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing
VTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong
indication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this
work explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation
metrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The
metrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,
density, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing
the metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best
across all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing
Environment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in
a controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle
equipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from
the VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans
were compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and
simulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU
of 21\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance
(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties
of simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model
outputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be
the most correlated among the metrics with perception methods.

Abstract: Robots must understand their environment from raw sensory inputs and reason
about the consequences of their actions in it to solve complex tasks. Behavior
Cloning (BC) leverages task-specific human demonstrations to learn this
knowledge as end-to-end policies. However, these policies are difficult to
transfer to new tasks, and generating training data is challenging because it
requires careful demonstrations and frequent environment resets. In contrast to
such policy-based view, in this paper we take a model-based approach where we
collect a few hours of unstructured easy-to-collect play data to learn an
action-conditioned visual world model, a diffusion-based action sampler, and
optionally a reward model. The world model -- in combination with the action
sampler and a reward model -- is then used to optimize long sequences of
actions with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner. The resulting plans are
executed on the robot via a zeroth-order Model Predictive Controller (MPC). We
show that the action sampler mitigates hallucinations of the world model during
planning and validate our approach on 3 real-world robotic tasks with varying
levels of planning and modeling complexity. Our experiments support the
hypothesis that planning leads to a significant improvement over BC baselines
on a standard manipulation test environment.

Abstract: Multi-legged robots offer enhanced stability to navigate complex terrains
with their multiple legs interacting with the environment. However, how to
effectively coordinate the multiple legs in a larger action exploration space
to generate natural and robust movements is a key issue. In this paper, we
introduce a motion prior-based approach, successfully applying deep
reinforcement learning algorithms to a real hexapod robot. We generate a
dataset of optimized motion priors, and train an adversarial discriminator
based on the priors to guide the hexapod robot to learn natural gaits. The
learned policy is then successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, and
demonstrate natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness without visual
information in complex terrains. This is the first time that a reinforcement
learning controller has been used to achieve complex terrain walking on a real
hexapod robot.

Conclusion: 该框架有效连接了高级意图与变形物体操作所需的细粒度力控制，实现了稳健的跨整个包装过程的性能。

Abstract: Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and
retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper,
bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains
difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the
need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the
task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem
involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.
Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly
wrapped package with clean folds and no tears.
  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task
planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid
imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is
a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from
human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike
vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short
tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal
grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process
and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than
merely replicating motion sequences.
  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We
show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized
models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level
intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object
manipulation.

Abstract: This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task
involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and
a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it
can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for
accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the
collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using
reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task
due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel
RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate
more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance
control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we
observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our
proposed approach compared to admittance control. The video of the experiments

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic
systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often
lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing
them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss
of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a
lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance
from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs
a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual
instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance
embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space,
allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief,
targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language
model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence
is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves
relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions.
Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse
policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task
success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that
GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping.
Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade,
rather than replace, validated robot policies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly
impact overall well-being and quality of life. Despite its widespread effects,
adequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient.
Advances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising
opportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step
toward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values
that shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this
study, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health
academic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the
design of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support. Through
creative, reflective, and envisioning activities, participants explored
scenarios and design possibilities, allowing for systematic elicitation of
values, expectations, needs, and preferences related to robot-supported
interventions. The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant
values-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support
for individuals with social anxiety. This study highlights the significance of
a research-led approach to value elicitation, emphasising user-centred and
context-aware design considerations in the development of socially assistive
robots.

Abstract: The human hand plays a vital role in daily life and industrial applications,
yet replicating its multifunctional capabilities-including motion, sensing, and
coordinated manipulation-with robotic systems remains a formidable challenge.
Developing a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with
engineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability,
and force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a
high-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7
passive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight
1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control
method to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior
performance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip
repeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared
to PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%,
significantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload
during collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps,
successfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation
tasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous
hands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation
and intelligent manufacturing.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key
research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and
enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of
these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper
introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for
analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through
LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain
knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting
natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time
series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2
CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to
filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP
server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling
with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source
(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling
capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both
proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that
there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude
Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that
there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool
description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools
available to the models. The code is available with a permissive license at

Abstract: Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans
have the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of
robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot
collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks
about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a
chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned
tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we
propose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user
human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy,
confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum
from egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space).
Results showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest
accuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator
of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased
accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive
load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to
apply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models
with robots' vision capabilities.

Abstract: Robust 3D semantic occupancy is crucial for legged/humanoid robots, yet most
semantic scene completion (SSC) systems target wheeled platforms with
forward-facing sensors. We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC
framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity.
OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular
panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and
grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and
cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening
free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D
for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and
(iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level
motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic
occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and
Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic
occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new
state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and
popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08
(cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround
perception for legged/humanoid robots. Datasets and code will be publicly

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced
significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation,
overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially
conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user
personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation
Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference
conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically
assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates
both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,
allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.
Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose
strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's
properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic
case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting
preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment
task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base
scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and
contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and
context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work
advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to
data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world
environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a
critical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to
navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by
tasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding
collisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in
decentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold
constraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a
manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for
decentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints
to capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a
decentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate
motion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions
about other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse
manifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional
multi-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms
existing constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for
real-world applications. Video demonstrations are available at

Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a geometric domain by
utilizing multiple search robots. The domain is a simply connected orthogonal
polygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a
limited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile
intruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard,
even for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our
attention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods
based on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search.
Moreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the
number of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the
search process while considering the geometric properties of the connected
orthogonal search area.

world's largest mural painted by a drone. Addressing the dual challenges of
maintaining artistic precision and operational reliability under adverse
outdoor conditions such as wind and direct sunlight, our work introduces a
robust system capable of navigating and painting outdoors with unprecedented
accuracy. Key to our approach is a novel navigation system that combines an
infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise
location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications.
We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in
tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise
trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for
trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing
and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying
mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent
airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's
critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and
consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for
autonomous large-scale art creation and expanding the functional applications
of robotics in creative fields.

Abstract: This paper addresses a motion planning problem to achieve
spatio-temporal-logical tasks, expressed by syntactically co-safe linear
temporal logic specifications (scLTL\next), in uncertain environments. Here,
the uncertainty is modeled as some probabilistic knowledge on the semantic
labels of the environment. For example, the task is "first go to region 1, then
go to region 2"; however, the exact locations of regions 1 and 2 are not known
a priori, instead a probabilistic belief is available. We propose a novel
automata-theoretic approach, where a special product automaton is constructed
to capture the uncertainty related to semantic labels, and a reward function is
designed for each edge of this product automaton. The proposed algorithm
utilizes value iteration for online replanning. We show some theoretical
results and present some simulations/experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach.

Abstract: This study investigates how human motion cues can be used to design
expressive robot-arm movements. Using the imperfect-information game Geister,
we analyzed two types of human piece-moving motions: natural gameplay
(unconscious tendencies) and instructed expressions (intentional cues). Based
on these findings, we created phase-specific robot motions by varying movement
speed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions under two
presentation modalities: a physical robot and a recorded video. Results
indicate that late-phase motion timing, particularly during withdrawal, plays
an important role in impression formation and that physical embodiment enhances
the interpretability of motion cues. These findings provide insights for
designing expressive robot motions based on human timing behavior.

Abstract: Conventional fluid-driven soft grippers typically depend on external sources,
which limit portability and long-term autonomy. This work introduces a
self-contained soft gripper with fixed size that operates solely through
internal liquid redistribution among three interconnected bistable snap-through
chambers. When the top sensing chamber deforms upon contact, the displaced
liquid triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling
stable and size-selective grasping without continuous energy input. The
internal hydraulic feedback further allows passive adaptation of gripping
pressure to object stiffness. This source-free and compact design opens new
possibilities for lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation in
soft robotics, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific
sampling and operation in underwater and field environments.

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够可靠地识别关键教育性错误，可作为支持放射学教育的可扩展工具。

Abstract: Objective: Radiology residents require timely, personalized feedback to
develop accurate image analysis and reporting skills. Increasing clinical
workload often limits attendings' ability to provide guidance. This study
evaluates a HIPAA-compliant GPT-4o system that delivers automated feedback on
breast imaging reports drafted by residents in real clinical settings.
  Methods: We analyzed 5,000 resident-attending report pairs from routine
practice at a multi-site U.S. health system. GPT-4o was prompted with clinical
instructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study
using 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four
residents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error
types were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement
between GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader
reliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was
measured as the proportion of cases rated helpful.
  Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition
of key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and
(3) final assessment inconsistent with findings. GPT-4o showed strong agreement
with attending consensus: 90.5%, 78.3%, and 90.4% across error types.
Inter-reader reliability showed moderate variability ({\alpha} = 0.767, 0.595,
0.567), and replacing a human reader with GPT-4o did not significantly affect
agreement ({\Delta} = -0.004 to 0.002). GPT's feedback was rated helpful in
most cases: 89.8%, 83.0%, and 92.0%.
  Discussion: ChatGPT-4o can reliably identify key educational errors. It may
serve as a scalable tool to support radiology education.

Abstract: As the automotive industry embraces software-defined vehicles (SDVs), the
role of user interface (UI) design in ensuring driver safety has become
increasingly significant. In crashes related to distracted driving, over 90%
did not involve cellphone use but were related to UI controls. However, many of
the existing UI SDV implementations do not consider Drive Distraction and
Inattention (DDI), which is reflected in many popular commercial vehicles. This
paper investigates the impact of UI designs on driver distraction and
inattention within the context of SDVs. Through a survey of popular commercial
vehicles, we identify UI features that potentially increase cognitive load and
evaluate design strategies to mitigate these risks. This survey highlights the
need for UI designs that balance advanced software functionalities with
driver-cognitive ergonomics. Findings aim to provide valuable guidance to
researchers and OEMs to contribute to the field of automotive UI, contributing
to the broader discussion on enhancing vehicular safety in the software-centric
automotive era.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个四象限技术分类法来系统化AI伴侣应用领域，基于虚拟vs具身和情感陪伴vs功能增强两个关键轴，为研究人员、开发者和政策制定者提供统一框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM基AI伴侣设计领域快速发展但碎片化，在目标、模态和技术栈上的多样性迫切需要统一框架来系统化该领域。

Method: 提出四象限技术分类法：基于虚拟vs具身和情感陪伴vs功能增强两个轴划分四个象限，分析每个象限的技术框架、挑战和关键技术。

Result: 建立了系统化的AI伴侣分类体系：第一象限分析虚拟情感陪伴的长期一致性挑战；第二象限分析功能虚拟助手的思维行动转变；第三四象限揭示具身智能的符号落地、数据隐私等核心挑战。

Conclusion: 该分类法为研究人员和开发者提供了导航复杂角色设计空间的系统地图，也为政策制定者识别和解决不同应用场景特有风险提供了基础。

Abstract: The design and application of LLM-based personas in AI companionship is a
rapidly expanding but fragmented field, spanning from virtual emotional compan-
ions and game NPCs to embodied functional robots. This diversity in objectives,
modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework.
To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a
Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework
is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional
Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship)
explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing
a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining
long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants)
analyzes AI applica- tions in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the
shift from "feeling" to "thinking and acting" and pinpointing key technologies
like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied
Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home
robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol
grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only
a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona
design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the
unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI设计工具的发展，设计师能高效生成大量设计想法，但需要从中选择少数潜在方案进行进一步开发。不同设计表示模态可能影响设计师的判断，因此研究这些模态如何影响设计选择对成功使用生成式设计工具至关重要。

Method: 通过研究不同设计模态（包括视觉渲染、数值性能数据及其组合）对设计师从AI生成的无人机设计概念中选择设计的影响，分析设计师的选择行为。

Result: 不同设计模态确实影响设计师的选择。出乎意料的是，仅提供数值设计性能数据时，设计师选择最优设计的能力最强。同时发现参与者偏好视觉传统的轴对称设计。

Conclusion: 研究结果为人机与生成式设计系统之间的交互提供了见解，强调了设计表示模态在设计选择过程中的重要性，特别是数值数据在优化设计决策中的关键作用。

Abstract: With generative AI-powered design tools, designers and engineers can
efficiently generate large numbers of design ideas. However, efficient
exploration of these ideas requires designers to select a smaller group of
potential solutions for further development. Therefore, the ability to judge
and evaluate designs is critical for the successful use of generative design
tools. Different design representation modalities can potentially affect
designers' judgments. This work investigates how different design modalities,
including visual rendering, numerical performance data, and a combination of
both, affect designers' design selections from AI-generated design concepts for
Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles. We found that different design modalities do affect
designers' choices. Unexpectedly, we found that providing only numerical design
performance data can lead to the best ability to select optimal designs. We
also found that participants prefer visually conventional designs with
axis-symmetry. The findings of this work provide insights into the interaction
between human users and generative design systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个开发上下文特定共情大语言模型的框架，通过分析真实对话数据集，使用合成多轮对话生成管道训练专门的共情适配器，显著缩小了感知与期望共情之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话AI中的共情表达通常是通用的，而非针对特定任务和上下文定制的，这导致了用户期望与实际体验之间的共情差距。

Method: 分析真实多轮对话数据集，开发合成多轮对话生成管道，基于上下文定义共情模式，训练上下文特定的共情专家适配器。

Result: 感知与期望共情之间的差距显著减少了72.66%，共情得分平均提高了2.43倍，共情专家适配器在保持对话轮次中的共情模式方面优于系统提示。

Conclusion: 上下文特定的共情适配器能有效缩小用户期望与实际体验之间的共情差距，并在长对话中保持稳定的共情表现。

Abstract: Empathy is a critical factor in fostering positive user experiences in
conversational AI. While models can display empathy, it is often generic rather
than tailored to specific tasks and contexts. In this work, we introduce a
novel framework for developing and evaluating context-specific empathetic large
language models (LLMs). We first analyze a real-world conversational dataset
consisting of 672 multi-turn conversations across 8 tasks, revealing
significant differences in terms of expected and experienced empathy before and
after the conversations, respectively. To help minimize this gap, we develop a
synthetic multi-turn conversational generation pipeline and steer responses
toward our defined empathy patterns based on the context that more closely
matches users' expectations. We then train empathetic expert adapters for
context-specific empathy that specialize in varying empathy levels based on the
recognized task. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant gap reduction
of 72.66% between perceived and desired empathy with scores increasing by an
average factor of 2.43 as measured by our metrics and reward models.
Additionally, our trained empathetic expert adapters demonstrate superior
effectiveness in preserving empathy patterns throughout conversation turns,
outperforming system prompts, which tend to dramatically diminish in impact as
conversations lengthen.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的快速普及，了解公众对这些系统在高风险领域(如医疗)的期望和认知至关重要，但目前尚不清楚现有叙述是否提供了平衡的观点。

Method: 分析了五个主要话语渠道(新闻、研究媒体、YouTube、TikTok和Reddit)两年期间的内容，考察词汇风格、信息内容和符号表征。

Result: 讨论总体积极且呈碎片化，积极性随时间增加；风险沟通不彻底，常简化为信息质量事件；LLMs生成性本质解释罕见；社交媒体更关注健康应用，语气和拟人化变化更大但风险关注少。

Conclusion: 公众话语可作为识别素养和治理差距的诊断工具，需要更好的沟通和设计策略来支持更明智的LLM参与。

Abstract: Representation shapes public attitudes and behaviors. With the arrival and
rapid adoption of LLMs, the way these systems are introduced will negotiate
societal expectations for their role in high-stakes domains like health. Yet it
remains unclear whether current narratives present a balanced view. We analyzed
five prominent discourse channels (news, research press, YouTube, TikTok, and
Reddit) over a two-year period on lexical style, informational content, and
symbolic representation. Discussions were generally positive and episodic, with
positivity increasing over time. Risk communication was unthorough and often
reduced to information quality incidents, while explanations of LLMs'
generative nature were rare. Compared with professional outlets, TikTok and
Reddit highlighted wellbeing applications and showed greater variations in tone
and anthropomorphism but little attention to risks. We discuss implications for
public discourse as a diagnostic tool in identifying literacy and governance
gaps, and for communication and design strategies to support more informed LLM
engagement.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，其生成低质量信息的风险日益受到关注，但这一概念定义模糊，且缺乏对LLM输出与传统信息源差异的系统研究。

Method: 在三个关键健康领域(疫苗、阿片类药物使用障碍、亲密伴侣暴力)中，与公共卫生专业人员和有相关生活经历的个人进行焦点小组讨论。

Result: 识别了LLM生成低质量信息的类型学，包括事实不准确之外的错误优先级和夸大等类型，并发现了LLM与传统信息源的根本性差异特征。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁信息质量的概念和方法论讨论应超越真实性，以应对新兴技术的能力和信息行为不断演变的动态。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have brought public and
scholarly attention to their potential in generating low-quality information.
While widely acknowledged as a risk, low-quality information remains a vaguely
defined concept, and little is known about how it manifests in LLM outputs or
how these outputs differ from those of traditional information sources. In this
study, we focus on two key questions: What types of low-quality information are
produced by LLMs, and what makes them distinct than human-generated
counterparts? We conducted focus groups with public health professionals and
individuals with lived experience in three critical health contexts (vaccines,
opioid use disorder, and intimate partner violence) where high-quality
information is essential and misinformation, bias, and insensitivity are
prevalent concerns. We identified a typology of LLM-generated low-quality
information and a set of distinctive LLM characteristics compared to
traditional information sources. Our findings show that low-quality information
extends beyond factual inaccuracies into types such as misprioritization and
exaggeration, and that LLM affordances fundamentally differs from previous
technologies. This work offers typologies on LLM distinctive characteristics
and low-quality information types as a starting point for future efforts to
understand LLM-generated low-quality information and mitigate related
informational harms. We call for conceptual and methodological discussions of
information quality to move beyond truthfulness, in order to address the
affordances of emerging technologies and the evolving dynamics of information
behaviors.

Abstract: Creating meaningful visual narratives through human-AI collaboration requires
understanding how text-image intertextuality emerges when textual intentions
meet AI-generated visuals. We conducted a three-phase qualitative study with 15
participants using GPT-4o to investigate how novices navigate sequential visual
narratives. Our findings show that users develop strategies to harness AI's
semantic surplus by recognizing meaningful visual content beyond literal
descriptions, iteratively refining prompts, and constructing narrative
significance through complementary text-image relationships. We identified four
distinct collaboration patterns and, through fsQCA's analysis, discovered three
pathways to successful intertextual collaboration: Educational Collaborator,
Technical Expert, and Visual Thinker. However, participants faced challenges,
including cultural representation gaps, visual consistency issues, and
difficulties translating narrative concepts into visual prompts. These findings
contribute to HCI research by providing an empirical account of
\textit{text-image intertextuality} in human-AI co-creation and proposing
design implications for role-based AI assistants that better support iterative,
human-led creative processes in visual storytelling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As the "agentic web" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered)
autonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to
protocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this
shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2),
and Ethereum's ERC-8004 "Trustless Agents," yet their underlying trust
assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of
trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party
verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g.
AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs
and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with
slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust
signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we
analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular
emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection,
sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and
misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle.
Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for
trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate
high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and
Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively
evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic
research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social
robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid
trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM
behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable,
and scalable agent economies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of interpreting
visualizations, yet they continue to struggle with spatial reasoning. One
proposed strategy is decomposition, which breaks down complex visualizations
into structured components. In this work, we examine the efficacy of scalable
vector graphics (SVGs) as a decomposition strategy for improving LMMs'
performance on floor plans comprehension. Floor plans serve as a valuable
testbed because they combine geometry, topology, and semantics, and their
reliable comprehension has real-world applications, such as accessibility for
blind and low-vision individuals. We conducted an exploratory study with three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct) across 75
floor plans. Results show that combining SVG with raster input (SVG+PNG)
improves performance on spatial understanding tasks but often hinders spatial
reasoning, particularly in pathfinding. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of decomposition as a strategy for advancing spatial
visualization comprehension.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart
homes has rapidly increased. A key challenge affecting user experience is how
to enable users to efficiently and intuitively select the devices they wish to
control. This paper proposes PnPSelect, a plug-and-play IoT device selection
solution utilizing Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology on commercial devices.
Unlike previous works, PnPSelect does not require the installation of dedicated
hardware on each IoT device, thereby reducing deployment costs and
complexities, and achieving true plug-and-play functionality. To enable
intuitive device selection, we introduce a pointing direction estimation method
that utilizes UWB readings from a single anchor to infer the user pointing
direction. Additionally, we propose a lightweight device localization method
that allows users to register new IoT devices by simply pointing at them from
two distinct positions, eliminating the need for manual measurements. We
implement PnPSelect on commercial smartphones and smartwatches and conduct
extensive evaluations in both controlled laboratory settings and real-world
environments. Our results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and
adaptability, making PnPSelect a practical and scalable solution for
next-generation smart home interactions.

Abstract: Our study aims to establish a unified, systematic, and referable knowledge
framework for the annotation of art image datasets, addressing issues of
ambiguous definitions and inconsistent results caused by the lack of common
standards during the annotation process. To achieve this goal, a hierarchical
and systematic art image knowledge graph was constructed. It was developed
based on the composition principles of art images, incorporating the Structured
Theory of Visual Knowledge proposed by Academician Yunhe Pan in On Visual
Knowledge-which states that visual knowledge must achieve precise expression of
spatial forms and dynamic relationships through "prototype-category" and
"hierarchical structure". Through in-depth review of Chinese and Western art
theories and pioneering integration of the Chinese cultural perspective, this
graph took shape. The core visual language of art images was deconstructed by
this knowledge graph. Meanwhile, the unique spatial theory and symbolic system
of Chinese painting were compared with and supplemented by Western art
theories. This graph converts qualitative artistic concepts into a clear
structured framework. It not only conforms to the cognitive law that "visual
knowledge takes precedence over verbal knowledge" in humans but also provides
an interpretable and inferential visual knowledge foundation for AI art
generation and cross-cultural art analysis. It ensures the high quality and
consistency of annotated data, thus offering key support for art intelligence
research in the AI 2.0 era.

Abstract: People are constantly in touch with surfaces in their lives, such as a sofa,
armrest, and table, making them natural tactile interfaces. Despite the recent
advancements in shape-changing surfaces, current available solutions are often
challenging to retrofit into ambient surfaces due to their bulky form factor or
high power requirements. We present \name, a foldable structure-enabled tactile
feedback mechanism that leverages the structural properties of Miura-Ori fold
to enable on-surface force actuation. The foldable structure allows the
surfaces to provide perpendicular force via lateral actuation, resulting in a
slim form factor that can be actuated via cable-based design using a servo
motor. We evaluate the system with a real-world prototype and a user study. The
user study shows that users can effectively distinguish multiple intensity
levels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放数据仓库对非专家用户存在可访问性障碍，需要数据集发现、模式映射和统计分析的专业知识。现有LLM在单个任务上表现良好，但在端到端工作流中存在根本性限制。

Method: 设计多智能体框架，包含意图澄清、数据集发现、分析和报告四个专业化智能体。这种架构保持各智能体的专注注意力，并在每个阶段实现验证。

Result: 评估5个模型和50个查询，得出多智能体LLM系统的五个设计原则：专业化独立于模型强度提供价值；智能体分为通用型和条件型；不同智能体缓解不同故障模式；架构优势在不同任务复杂度下保持稳定；智能体效果因模型而异需要模型感知设计。

Conclusion: 多智能体专业化对于复杂分析工作流是必要的，通过自然语言接口实现公共数据的更广泛访问。

Abstract: Open data repositories hold potential for evidence-based decision-making, yet
are inaccessible to non-experts lacking expertise in dataset discovery, schema
mapping, and statistical analysis. Large language models show promise for
individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental
limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning
patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a
multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition
into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,
and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent
contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models
and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.
First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the
strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model
scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and
conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent
effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev
20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or
analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing
report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits
persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%
discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning
enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%
for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide
when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while
enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.

categories using a consensus-driven evaluation protocol. Our multi-agent
framework aggregates pattern audits and issue codes into ground-truth labels
via scalable majority voting, enabling reproducible comparison of LLM
evaluators without human annotation. Applied to large-scale complementary-item
recommendation, the benchmark reports four key findings: (i) Anthropic Claude
3.5 Sonnet achieves the highest decision confidence; (ii) Gemini 1.5 Pro offers
the best overall performance across categories; (iii) GPT-4o provides the most
favorable latency-accuracy-cost tradeoff; and (iv) GPT-OSS 20B leads among
open-source models. Category-level analysis shows strong consensus in
structured domains (Electronics, Sports) but persistent disagreement in
lifestyle categories (Clothing, Food). These results establish ScalingEval as a

to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this
context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or
false answers (e.g., "what is the capital of England?"), and probabilistic
knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., "what
is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?"). In this paper, our goal
is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of
knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that
LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they
internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful
universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,
classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight
fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,
challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we
develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating
whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world
populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social
behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not
seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the
context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that
language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer
1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional
(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also
limited.

TL;DR: SnapStream是一种KV缓存压缩方法，可在静态图和连续批处理的工业部署中实现4倍内存使用改进，在DeepSeek-671B等大模型上验证有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着100B+参数大语言模型和100k+上下文长度的普及，对片上内存需求激增，但现有KV缓存压缩技术难以在工业框架中部署，且对现代指令跟随和推理模型的准确性影响不明确。

Method: 开发SnapStream KV缓存压缩方法，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和DeepSeek-R1上探索准确性影响，并在SambaNova SN40L加速器上部署16路张量并行的DeepSeek-671B。

Result: 在128k上下文长度和1832 tokens/秒的生产环境中，SnapStream实现4倍内存使用改进，在LongBench-v2、AIME24和LiveCodeBench上引入最小准确性下降。

Conclusion: SnapStream是首个在静态图和连续批处理的生产推理系统中部署的稀疏KV注意力技术，有效解决了大模型KV缓存的内存挑战。

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+
context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory
to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV
demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet,
these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using
frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static
graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it
difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention
algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such
techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well
understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this
paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be
deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way
tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators
running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real
production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage
and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and
LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation
of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system
with static graphs and continuous batching.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于能力的大语言模型监控新方法，取代传统的基于任务的监控，通过围绕共享模型能力（如摘要、推理、翻译等）组织监控，实现跨任务系统性弱点和长尾错误的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习监控方法基于任务和假设性能退化，但大语言模型并非针对特定任务训练，传统方法不适用。需要一种适应通用大语言模型特性的监控方法。

Method: 提出能力基础监控方法，围绕共享模型能力而非下游任务组织监控，检测系统性弱点、长尾错误和涌现行为。

Result: 该方法为医疗领域大语言模型监控提供了可扩展的基础框架，能够发现任务基础监控可能遗漏的问题。

Conclusion: 能力基础监控为大语言模型和未来通用人工智能模型在医疗领域的安全、自适应和协作监控提供了可扩展基础。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches,
inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on
assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with
LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to
the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any
specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing
principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in
how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based
monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are
generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across
numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task
independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model
capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety
guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses,
long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss.
We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and
professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach.
Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for
safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist
artificial intelligence models in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在数学奥林匹克竞赛问题上的表现不佳，部分原因是形式化与非形式化陈述之间存在差异，影响了定理证明管道的整体性能。

Method: 对miniF2F基准测试进行深入分析，识别并修正形式化与非形式化陈述中的错误、差异和简化，创建完全验证的miniF2F-v2数据集。

Result: 在原始miniF2F上最佳准确率为36%，修正后的miniF2F-v2上提升至70%，揭示了自动形式化模型与定理证明器之间的显著不对齐问题。

Conclusion: 高质量基准测试有助于更好地评估形式推理领域的进展，并更准确地诊断自动形式化和定理证明模型的失败与成功模式。

Abstract: We perform a thorough analysis of the formal and informal statements in the
miniF2F benchmark from the perspective of an AI system that is tasked to
participate in a math Olympiad consisting of the problems in miniF2F. In such
setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,
formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it
will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the
original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results
reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA
models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA
accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving
literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion
of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for
more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the
errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,
and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements
and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to
the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the
original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the
autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a
higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the
field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success
modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models. Our dataset is available
at https://github.com/roozbeh-yz/miniF2F_v2.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型(MLLM)辅助设计烟花算法(FWA)的新方法，通过引入关键部分(CP)概念扩展FWA处理复杂高维任务的能力，并在旅行商问题(TSP)和电子设计自动化问题(EDA)上取得了优于或达到SOTA水平的结果。

Motivation: 随着优化问题日益复杂多样，传统零阶或一阶方法在处理非凸性、高维性、黑盒特性等问题时效率低下、梯度信息不准确且优化信息利用不足。大语言模型在语言理解和代码生成方面的显著进步为优化算法设计提供了新思路。

Conclusion: 大语言模型辅助的优化算法设计方法能够有效提升传统优化算法在复杂高维问题上的性能，为优化算法创新提供了新的范式。

Abstract: As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements
in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant
importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily
manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and
other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order
methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient
information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are
ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the
rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial
improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.
Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language
models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we
choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel
approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large
language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical
Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further
utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the
multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific
tasks: the \textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \textit{electronic
design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs
generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on
many problem instances.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
associated security issues have become increasingly prominent, severely
constraining their trustworthy deployment in critical domains. This paper
proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard
LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework
employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a
fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused
Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling
of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario
adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level,
the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a
specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are
grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates
information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly
higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the
baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk
test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score,
validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.
This research provides an effective engineering pathway for building
high-security, high-trust LLM applications.

Abstract: Formal explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) offers unique theoretical

Abstract: The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains,
leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional
methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this,
we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework
that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces
specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine
design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the
aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of
three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems
Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to
construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature.
The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical
requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer
leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose
candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and
provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge
graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the
manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics
such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how
collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can
enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be
interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from
minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality
Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine
other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing
human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from
LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >
0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on
semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms
trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that
LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five
responses into natural language personality summaries through information
selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.
Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these
summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality
factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item
importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely
redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to
original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,
second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs
can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from
minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a
powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their
emergent reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Ensuring web accessibility is crucial for advancing social welfare, justice,
and equality in digital spaces, yet the vast majority of website user
interfaces remain non-compliant, due in part to the resource-intensive and
unscalable nature of current auditing practices. While WCAG-EM offers a
structured methodology for site-wise conformance evaluation, it involves great
human efforts and lacks practical support for execution at scale. In this work,
we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a
human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a
graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page
coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and
MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors
through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks.
Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility
auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world
impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking
core stages of the audit pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods, providing insights that small-scale language
models can serve as capable experts when fine-tuned.

Abstract: AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for
environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and
reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite
human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued:
most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple
rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to
achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized
by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a
model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played
at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and
equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also
outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning
abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies,
randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class
human players.
