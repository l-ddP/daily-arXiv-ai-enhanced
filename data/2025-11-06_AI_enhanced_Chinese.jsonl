The\nframework is designed to improve risk awareness and preparedness among various\nstakeholders, including citizens, local authorities, and emergency responders.\nUsing immersive XR technologies, the training experience simulates real-world\nemergency scenarios, contributing to active participation and a deeper\nunderstanding of potential hazards and especially for floods. The framework\nhighlights the importance of stakeholder participation in its development,\nensuring that training modules are customized to address the specific needs of\ndifferent user groups. The iterative approach of the framework supports ongoing\nrefinement through user feedback and performance data, thus improving the\noverall effectiveness of risk training initiatives. This work outlines the\nmethodological phases involved in the framework's implementation, including i)\nuser flow mapping, ii) scenario selection, and iii) performance evaluation,\nwith a focus on the pilot application in Senigallia, Italy.

Increasing clinical\nworkload often limits attendings' ability to provide guidance. This study\nevaluates a HIPAA-compliant GPT-4o system that delivers automated feedback on\nbreast imaging reports drafted by residents in real clinical settings.\n  Methods: We analyzed 5,000 resident-attending report pairs from routine\npractice at a multi-site U.S. health system. GPT-4o was prompted with clinical\ninstructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study\nusing 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four\nresidents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error\ntypes were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement\nbetween GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader\nreliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was\nmeasured as the proportion of cases rated helpful.\n  Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition\nof key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and\n(3) final assessment inconsistent with findings. GPT-4o showed strong agreement\nwith attending consensus: 90.5%, 78.3%, and 90.4% across error types.\nInter-reader reliability showed moderate variability ({\\alpha} = 0.767, 0.595,\n0.567), and replacing a human reader with GPT-4o did not significantly affect\nagreement ({\\Delta} = -0.004 to 0.002).

However, these properties are not fully captured by\ndata augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on\ntransformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a\ntraining methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire\ninput space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training\nset to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which\nwe refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce\nfunctional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the\ntraining dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised\nmanner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled\nvirtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across\ndatasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently\noutperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property.

Since comprehensive\nconventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,\nVirtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing\nVTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong\nindication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this\nwork explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation\nmetrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The\nmetrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,\ndensity, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing\nthe metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best\nacross all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing\nEnvironment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in\na controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle\nequipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from\nthe VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans\nwere compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and\nsimulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU\nof 21\\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance\n(DCD) of 0.63.

Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design.

As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment\nbetween the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for\neffective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and\nvision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment.\nThis shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D\nscenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address\nthis, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse\ntools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate\nalignment assessments.

Behavior\nCloning (BC) leverages task-specific human demonstrations to learn this\nknowledge as end-to-end policies. However, these policies are difficult to\ntransfer to new tasks, and generating training data is challenging because it\nrequires careful demonstrations and frequent environment resets. In contrast to\nsuch policy-based view, in this paper we take a model-based approach where we\ncollect a few hours of unstructured easy-to-collect play data to learn an\naction-conditioned visual world model, a diffusion-based action sampler, and\noptionally a reward model. The world model -- in combination with the action\nsampler and a reward model -- is then used to optimize long sequences of\nactions with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner.

A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u638c\u63e1\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5185\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc5\u5492\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u53e3\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5185\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff08PCH\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u6b21\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5176\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

While models can display empathy, it is often generic rather\nthan tailored to specific tasks and contexts. In this work, we introduce a\nnovel framework for developing and evaluating context-specific empathetic large\nlanguage models (LLMs). We first analyze a real-world conversational dataset\nconsisting of 672 multi-turn conversations across 8 tasks, revealing\nsignificant differences in terms of expected and experienced empathy before and\nafter the conversations, respectively.

In such\nsetting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,\nformalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it\nwill get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the\noriginal informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results\nreveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA\nmodels in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA\naccuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving\nliterature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion\nof this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for\nmore than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the\nerrors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,\nand present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements\nand proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to\nthe best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the\noriginal miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the\nautoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a\nhigher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the\nfield of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success\nmodes of autoformalization and theorem proving models.

The model uses one encoder with learnable\nmodality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding\nobjective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance\nregularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation\ndiversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality\nand allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It\nis trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised\nreconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A\nlearnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can\nadjust to different inputs.

Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains\ndifficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the\nneed for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the\ntask of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem\ninvolving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.\nSuccess is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly\nwrapped package with clean folds and no tears.\n  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task\nplanner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid\nimitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is\na Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from\nhuman demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal\ndependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike\nvanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short\ntasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal\ngrounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks.

In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This\ndecoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually\ndiscriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently\noutperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and\ndomain generalization settings.

We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of\nmisinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a\ncritical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are\nincreasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known\nabout whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a\nconspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated\npsychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under\ndifferent prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs\nshow partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning\nwith socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent\ndemographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses\ntoward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs\nto manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive\ncontexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the\npsychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social\nscience and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
